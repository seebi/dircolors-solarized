Solarized Colorscheme for Gnome Terminal
========================================

Scripts for setting the Solarized color set with Gnome Terminal. To get nicely
colored directory listings, you will also need to set up a [dircolors solarised
color theme].

For Mate Terminal, you can use [mate-terminal-colors-solarized], maintained
by @cledoux.

Colors
------

Only the foreground, background and highlight colors are different in the light
and dark color sets, as one of the main ideas behind Ethan Schonoovers work is
to use the same colors in the palette for both.

See the [Solarized homepage] for theory behind the colors, screenshots, details
and colorscheme versions for Vim, Mutt, popular terminal emulators and other
applications.

For the original works of Ethan Schoonover, visit the [Solarized repository].
The scripts for Gnome Terminal is maintained in [Gnome Terminal Colors
Solarized repository].

Installation and usage
----------------------

To be able to uninstall, we highly recommend that you create a new Gnome
Terminal profile, using the menus in Gnome Terminal.

You need the `dconf` command (if you run a recent Gnome version). With Ubuntu,
this can be installed by running

    $ sudo apt-get install dconf-cli

Then clone the repository and you can run the installation script:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized.git
    $ cd gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
    $ ./install.sh

And just follow the instructions.

You can also run the `set_dark.sh` or `set_light.sh` script, to directly set
the dark or light solarized theme to the actived gnome-terminal profile. The
options `--install-dircolors` or `--skip-dircolors` can also be used to install
or not the solarized dircolors in a non-interactive mode.

Uninstall
---------

Change to another profile in Gnome Terminal, then remove the Solarized profile
by running:

### Gnome 3.6 or lower

    $ rm -r ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Solarized/
    $ gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/gnome-terminal

### Gnome 3.8 or higher

Be sure to have the dconf-cli package installed and do:

    $ dconf reset -f /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/PROFILE_ID"

Replace PROFILE_ID by your profile ID (you can get it in your profile
configuration in gnome-terminal).

Themes
------

Each theme has is own folder in the `colors` dir. It contains the following
files:

  * bd_color: bold color
  * bg_color: background color
  * fg_color: foreground color
  * palette: list of colors for all standard color codes.

No additional configuration is needed to add a theme, the installation script
just list at launch the children folders in the `colors` dir.

colors.
